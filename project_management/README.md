# Project Management

This directory contains project management files, documentation, and status reports to keep the root directory clean and organized.

## Directory Structure

```
project_management/
├── documentation/          # Project documentation and summaries
│   └── ORGANIZATION_SUMMARY.md
├── status/                # Status reports and tracking
│   └── REORGANIZATION_STATUS.md
└── temp/                  # Temporary project management files (git ignored)
```

## Files

### Documentation (`documentation/`)
- **ORGANIZATION_SUMMARY.md** - Comprehensive summary of the test suite optimizer project organization and structure

### Status (`status/`)
- **REORGANIZATION_STATUS.md** - Status report of the project reorganization effort, including completed tasks and known issues

## Purpose

This structure keeps project management artifacts separate from the main codebase while maintaining easy access to important project information. All temporary project management files should go in the `temp/` directory which is ignored by git.
