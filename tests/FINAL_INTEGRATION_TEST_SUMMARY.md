### Recent Fixes Applied (2025-08-24)

#### Fix 1: Duplicate Message Handling

**Issue Resolved:** Duplicate leveling processing was occurring due to two separate message handler systems both calling the leveling service.

**Root Cause:**

- `modules/message_handler.py` (main handler) with `_process_leveling_system`
- `modules/handlers/message_handlers.py` (new handler) also calling leveling service directly

**Solution Applied:**

- ‚úÖ Removed leveling processing from `modules/handlers/message_handlers.py`
- ‚úÖ Ensured only `modules/message_handler.py` processes leveling via `_process_leveling_system`
- ‚úÖ Added comprehensive tests to prevent regression

#### Fix 2: Achievement Unlock Persistence

**Issue Resolved:** Achievements were being detected as "new" but never saved to database, causing duplicate achievement notifications.

**Root Cause:**

- `UserLevelingService` was checking for new achievements and sending notifications
- But it was NOT calling `unlock_achievements()` to save them to the database
- Next check would see them as "new" again, causing duplicates

**Solution Applied:**

- ‚úÖ Added `achievement_engine.unlock_achievements()` call in `_award_xp_to_user` method
- ‚úÖ Added proper error handling for achievement unlocking
- ‚úÖ Fixed both regular and retroactive achievement processing
- ‚úÖ Achievements are now properly persisted to database

#### Fix 3: Duplicate Achievement Definitions

**Issue Resolved:** Database contained duplicate achievement definitions with same titles but different IDs, causing multiple identical achievements to be unlocked.

**Root Cause:**

- Database had both `newcomer` and `novice` achievements with title "üë∂ –ù–æ–≤–∞—á–æ–∫"
- Both had same condition (`messages_count=1`)
- When user sent first message, both achievements were unlocked
- Also had duplicate Twitter-related achievements

**Solution Applied:**

- ‚úÖ Identified duplicate achievements in database
- ‚úÖ Removed duplicate `novice` achievement (kept `newcomer`)
- ‚úÖ Removed duplicate `twitter_user` achievement (kept `twitter_fan`)
- ‚úÖ Cleaned up associated user achievements for removed duplicates
- ‚úÖ Reduced total achievements from 39 to 37 (removed 2 duplicates)

#### Fix 4: Context-Dependent Achievement Conditions (PRODUCTION FIX)

**Issue Resolved:** Many achievement conditions weren't working in production because they required message context data (photos, Twitter links, videos, etc.) that wasn't being provided.

**Root Cause:**

- Previous fix was reverted - `UserLevelingService` wasn't using `XPCalculator` to analyze message content
- Achievement engine was calling `check_condition()` without context data
- All context-dependent achievements (photos, videos, Twitter links, etc.) always returned `False`
- Only basic achievements (messages, XP, level) were working

**Solution Applied:**

- ‚úÖ Re-added `analyze_message_content()` method to `XPCalculator` class
- ‚úÖ Modified `_check_achievements_safe()` to analyze message content using XP calculator
- ‚úÖ Updated calls to pass message context to achievement checking
- ‚úÖ All 14 context-dependent achievement types now work:
  - `photos_shared`, `twitter_links`, `videos_uploaded`, `stickers_sent`
  - `voice_messages`, `documents_shared`, `polls_created`, `reactions_given`
  - `hashtags_used`, `mentions_made`, `emojis_used`, `long_messages`
  - `night_owl_messages`, `weekend_messages`

#### Fix 5: Profile Command User Lookup (PRODUCTION FIX)

**Issue Resolved:** Profile command couldn't find users who existed in the database but had no leveling data in the current chat.

**Root Cause:**

- `_find_user_by_username()` only searched the `users` table
- Didn't verify if user had leveling data in the current chat
- Users without leveling data in that chat would be found but then show "no leveling data"

**Solution Applied:**

- ‚úÖ Updated query to JOIN `users` with `user_stats` table
- ‚úÖ Added chat_id filter to ensure user has leveling data in current chat
- ‚úÖ Now correctly returns "not found" for users without leveling data in that chat

#### Fix 6: Leaderboard UserAchievement Attribute Error (PRODUCTION FIX)

**Issue Resolved:** Leaderboard command failing with `'UserAchievement' object has no attribute 'achievement'`.

**Root Cause:**

- `get_leaderboard()` method was calling `get_user_achievements()` which returns `UserAchievement` objects
- Code was trying to access `.achievement` attribute on `UserAchievement` objects
- `UserAchievement` only has `achievement_id`, not the full `Achievement` object

**Solution Applied:**

- ‚úÖ Changed to use `get_user_achievements_with_details()` method instead
- ‚úÖ This method returns `List[Tuple[UserAchievement, Achievement]]` with full achievement details
- ‚úÖ Updated code to extract achievements from the tuples correctly

**Tests Added:**

- `test_new_message_handler_does_not_call_leveling` - Ensures new handler doesn't duplicate processing
- `test_no_duplicate_leveling_processing` - Comprehensive validation of single processing

**Validation Results:**

- ‚úÖ Main message handler calls leveling system correctly
- ‚úÖ New message handler does NOT call leveling system (avoiding duplication)
- ‚úÖ Achievements are properly saved to database when unlocked
- ‚úÖ Duplicate achievement definitions removed from database
- ‚úÖ No more duplicate achievement notifications
- ‚úÖ Clean achievement system with unique titles and IDs
- ‚úÖ Context-dependent achievements now work correctly in production
- ‚úÖ Message content analysis provides proper context data for achievements
- ‚úÖ Profile command correctly finds users with leveling data only
- ‚úÖ Leaderboard command now works without UserAchievement attribute errors
- ‚úÖ All message handler integration tests passing
