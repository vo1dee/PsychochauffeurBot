# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses the remaining test failures in the Enhanced Configuration Manager test suite. While significant progress has been made in fixing several test failures, there are still 3 failing tests that need to be resolved to ensure the configuration management system is fully functional and reliable.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all Enhanced Configuration Manager tests to pass, so that I can be confident the configuration system works correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running the enhanced config manager test suite THEN all tests SHALL pass without failures
2. WHEN the merge strategies are tested THEN the replace strategy SHALL completely remove nested sections as expected
3. WHEN configuration inheritance is tested THEN global settings SHALL be properly merged with scope-specific overrides
4. WHEN the full config lifecycle is tested THEN configuration updates SHALL be applied correctly

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the configuration merge strategies to work correctly, so that I can reliably update configurations with different merge behaviors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using the "replace" merge strategy THEN existing nested sections SHALL be completely replaced, not merged
2. WHEN using the "deep_merge" strategy THEN nested configurations SHALL be merged recursively
3. WHEN updating a configuration with replace strategy THEN only the specified keys SHALL remain in the target section
4. WHEN updating a configuration with deep_merge strategy THEN existing keys SHALL be preserved unless explicitly overridden

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want configuration inheritance to work properly, so that global settings can be overridden by scope-specific configurations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN getting an effective configuration THEN global default settings SHALL be included as the base
2. WHEN scope-specific overrides exist THEN they SHALL take precedence over global settings
3. WHEN merging configurations THEN the structure SHALL maintain both global settings and scope overrides
4. WHEN accessing inherited configurations THEN all expected fields SHALL be present and accessible

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the configuration lifecycle tests to work correctly, so that I can verify the complete configuration management workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN updating a configuration THEN the changes SHALL be applied correctly
2. WHEN retrieving an updated configuration THEN the new values SHALL be returned
3. WHEN performing multiple configuration operations THEN each operation SHALL work independently
4. WHEN testing the full lifecycle THEN all operations SHALL complete successfully
