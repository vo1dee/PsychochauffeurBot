# Design Document

## Overview

This design addresses the three remaining test failures in the Enhanced Configuration Manager test suite. The failures are related to configuration merge strategies, inheritance mechanisms, and lifecycle operations. The solution involves fixing the underlying implementation logic to match the expected test behaviors.

## Architecture

The Enhanced Configuration Manager uses a layered architecture with:
- Configuration storage and retrieval layer
- Merge strategy implementation layer  
- Inheritance and effective configuration layer
- Caching and optimization layer

The fixes will focus on the merge strategy and inheritance layers without disrupting the overall architecture.

## Components and Interfaces

### Merge Strategy Component

The merge strategy component handles different ways of combining configuration data:

**Current Issues:**
- Replace strategy not completely replacing nested sections
- Deep merge strategy not properly preserving existing keys

**Design Solution:**
- Fix `_replace_merge` method to completely replace nested dictionaries
- Ensure `_deep_merge` method properly handles nested structures
- Add proper handling for configuration modules with overrides vs settings

### Configuration Inheritance Component

The inheritance component manages how global and scope-specific configurations are combined:

**Current Issues:**
- `get_effective_config` not properly merging global defaults with scope overrides
- Missing proper handling of settings vs overrides structure

**Design Solution:**
- Implement proper deep merge logic for effective configurations
- Handle the distinction between `settings` (global defaults) and `overrides` (scope-specific)
- Ensure all expected fields are present in the merged result

### Configuration Update Component

The update component handles configuration modifications:

**Current Issues:**
- Update operations not applying changes correctly in some scenarios
- Inconsistent behavior between different update paths

**Design Solution:**
- Ensure update operations use the correct merge strategy
- Validate that updates are properly persisted and retrievable
- Fix any caching issues that might prevent updates from being reflected

## Data Models

### Configuration Structure

```python
{
    "chat_metadata": {
        "chat_id": str,
        "chat_type": str,
        "chat_name": str (optional)
    },
    "config_modules": {
        "module_name": {
            "enabled": bool,
            "settings": {  # Global defaults
                "key": value
            },
            "overrides": {  # Scope-specific overrides
                "key": value
            }
        }
    },
    "_metadata": {
        "version": str,
        "created_at": str,
        "updated_at": str,
        "checksum": str,
        "source": str
    }
}
```

### Effective Configuration Structure

When merging global and scope configurations, the effective configuration should combine:
- Global `settings` as the base
- Scope-specific `overrides` taking precedence
- Result should have a unified `settings` structure with merged values

## Error Handling

### Merge Strategy Errors
- Handle cases where configurations have incompatible structures
- Provide clear error messages for invalid merge operations
- Ensure partial failures don't corrupt existing configurations

### Inheritance Errors
- Handle missing global configurations gracefully
- Provide defaults when scope configurations are incomplete
- Log warnings for unexpected configuration structures

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Test each merge strategy independently with various input combinations
- Test inheritance logic with different global/scope configuration combinations
- Test edge cases like missing configurations, empty configurations, and malformed data

### Integration Tests
- Test the complete configuration lifecycle with realistic data
- Verify that updates persist correctly and are retrievable
- Test concurrent access scenarios

### Test Data Patterns
- Use consistent test data structures that match real-world usage
- Include both simple and complex nested configuration scenarios
- Test with various configuration scopes (global, chat, user, module)

## Implementation Approach

### Phase 1: Fix Merge Strategies
1. Analyze current `_replace_merge` implementation
2. Fix the logic to completely replace nested sections
3. Verify `_deep_merge` handles all nested scenarios correctly
4. Update tests to validate the fixes

### Phase 2: Fix Configuration Inheritance  
1. Analyze `get_effective_config` implementation
2. Fix the merging logic to properly combine global settings with scope overrides
3. Ensure the result structure matches test expectations
4. Handle the settings vs overrides distinction properly

### Phase 3: Fix Configuration Updates
1. Analyze the update workflow in the lifecycle test
2. Identify why updates aren't being applied correctly
3. Fix any caching or persistence issues
4. Ensure updates are immediately reflected in subsequent retrievals

### Phase 4: Validation and Testing
1. Run all tests to ensure fixes work correctly
2. Verify no regressions in previously passing tests
3. Add additional test cases if needed to prevent future regressions
4. Update documentation if implementation details change
