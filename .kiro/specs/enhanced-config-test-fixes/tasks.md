# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Fix merge strategy implementation
  - Analyze the current `_replace_merge` method behavior in the enhanced config manager
  - Fix the replace merge logic to completely replace nested sections instead of merging them
  - Update the `_replace_nested` helper method to return only the update data, not merged data
  - Test the fix against the failing `test_merge_strategies` test case
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.3_

- [x] 2. Fix configuration inheritance mechanism
  - Analyze the `get_effective_config` method and its interaction with global/scope configurations
  - Implement proper deep merge logic that combines global `settings` with scope-specific `overrides`
  - Ensure the effective configuration structure includes both inherited and overridden values
  - Fix the configuration structure to properly handle settings vs overrides distinction
  - Test the fix against the failing `test_config_inheritance` test case
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4_

- [x] 3. Fix configuration update workflow
  - Analyze the configuration update process in the `update_config` method
  - Identify why configuration updates are not being applied correctly in the lifecycle test
  - Fix any issues with merge strategy application during updates
  - Ensure updated configurations are properly persisted and immediately retrievable
  - Test the fix against the failing `test_full_config_lifecycle` test case
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4_

- [x] 4. Validate all test fixes and ensure no regressions
  - Run the complete enhanced config manager test suite to verify all fixes work
  - Ensure previously passing tests still pass after the fixes
  - Add any additional test cases needed to prevent future regressions
  - Update any documentation that may have changed due to implementation fixes
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4_
