# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses the comprehensive test suite failures across the entire codebase. While the Test Suite Optimizer component is working perfectly (65/65 tests passing), the broader test suite has significant issues including async event loop problems, API interface mismatches, and missing dependencies that need systematic resolution.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all async tests to run properly, so that I can verify async functionality works correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running async tests THEN they SHALL execute without "RuntimeError: There is no current event loop in thread 'MainThread'" errors
2. WHEN pytest-asyncio is configured THEN async test methods SHALL have proper event loop management
3. WHEN async decorators are used THEN they SHALL be properly configured for the test environment
4. WHEN running the full test suite THEN async tests SHALL not interfere with synchronous tests

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want API interface consistency, so that tests match the actual implementation signatures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests call class constructors THEN they SHALL use the correct parameter names and types
2. WHEN tests call methods THEN they SHALL use the correct method signatures as implemented
3. WHEN tests expect attributes THEN those attributes SHALL exist in the actual implementation
4. WHEN API changes occur THEN tests SHALL be updated to match the new interfaces

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all referenced classes and functions to exist, so that tests can import and use them successfully.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests import classes THEN those classes SHALL be defined and available
2. WHEN tests reference functions THEN those functions SHALL exist in the expected modules
3. WHEN tests use mock objects THEN they SHALL properly mock the actual interfaces
4. WHEN dependencies are missing THEN they SHALL be implemented or tests SHALL be updated

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper test configuration, so that all test types run correctly in the test environment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running pytest THEN the configuration SHALL support both sync and async tests
2. WHEN using test fixtures THEN they SHALL be properly scoped and available
3. WHEN tests require specific setup THEN the test environment SHALL provide it
4. WHEN running coverage analysis THEN it SHALL accurately measure test coverage

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want consistent test patterns, so that all tests follow the same structure and conventions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN writing test classes THEN they SHALL follow consistent naming and structure patterns
2. WHEN using mocks THEN they SHALL be properly configured and cleaned up
3. WHEN testing error conditions THEN they SHALL use consistent error handling patterns
4. WHEN asserting results THEN they SHALL use appropriate assertion methods

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want integration tests to work properly, so that I can verify component interactions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running integration tests THEN they SHALL properly set up test environments
2. WHEN testing service interactions THEN they SHALL use appropriate mocking strategies
3. WHEN testing database operations THEN they SHALL use test databases or proper mocks
4. WHEN testing external APIs THEN they SHALL use mocks or test endpoints
