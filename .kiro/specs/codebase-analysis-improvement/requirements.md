# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for conducting a comprehensive analysis of the PsychochauffeurBot codebase and implementing systematic improvements to enhance code quality, maintainability, performance, and security. The bot is a complex Python-based Telegram bot that provides video downloading, AI integration, weather services, and various utility features.

## Requirements

3. WHEN reviewing security aspects THEN the system SHALL identify potential vulnerabilities and security risks
4. WHEN assessing performance THEN the system SHALL identify bottlenecks and inefficient implementations
5. WHEN examining error handling THEN the system SHALL evaluate the consistency and effectiveness of error management
6. WHEN reviewing documentation THEN the system SHALL assess the completeness and quality of code documentation

### Requirement 2: Code Quality Improvement

**User Story:** As a maintainer, I want to improve code quality through standardization and best practices implementation, so that the codebase becomes more maintainable and less prone to bugs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing code standards THEN the system SHALL establish consistent coding patterns across all modules
2. WHEN refactoring code THEN the system SHALL reduce code duplication and improve modularity
3. WHEN improving readability THEN the system SHALL enhance variable naming, function structure, and code organization
4. WHEN adding type hints THEN the system SHALL provide comprehensive type annotations for better IDE support and error detection
5. WHEN standardizing imports THEN the system SHALL organize imports consistently across all files
6. WHEN implementing docstrings THEN the system SHALL provide comprehensive documentation for all public functions and classes

### Requirement 3: Architecture and Design Pattern Enhancement

**User Story:** As a software architect, I want to improve the overall architecture and implement proper design patterns, so that the system becomes more scalable and easier to extend.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing dependency injection THEN the system SHALL reduce tight coupling between components
2. WHEN applying design patterns THEN the system SHALL use appropriate patterns like Factory, Observer, and Strategy where beneficial
3. WHEN organizing modules THEN the system SHALL create clear separation of concerns and logical grouping
4. WHEN implementing interfaces THEN the system SHALL define clear contracts between components
5. WHEN managing configuration THEN the system SHALL centralize and standardize configuration management
6. WHEN handling async operations THEN the system SHALL implement proper async/await patterns consistently

### Requirement 4: Error Handling and Logging Standardization

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want consistent and comprehensive error handling and logging, so that I can effectively monitor and troubleshoot the system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN handling errors THEN the system SHALL use standardized error handling patterns across all modules
2. WHEN logging events THEN the system SHALL provide consistent log formatting and appropriate log levels
3. WHEN managing exceptions THEN the system SHALL implement proper exception hierarchies and handling strategies
4. WHEN tracking errors THEN the system SHALL provide comprehensive error tracking and analytics
5. WHEN debugging issues THEN the system SHALL provide sufficient context and traceability information
6. WHEN monitoring system health THEN the system SHALL implement proper health checks and status reporting

### Requirement 5: Performance Optimization

**User Story:** As an end user, I want the bot to respond quickly and efficiently handle concurrent requests, so that I have a smooth and responsive experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing requests THEN the system SHALL optimize database queries and reduce unnecessary operations
2. WHEN handling concurrent operations THEN the system SHALL implement proper async patterns and resource management
3. WHEN managing memory THEN the system SHALL prevent memory leaks and optimize memory usage
4. WHEN caching data THEN the system SHALL implement appropriate caching strategies for frequently accessed data
5. WHEN processing large files THEN the system SHALL handle file operations efficiently without blocking
6. WHEN making external API calls THEN the system SHALL implement proper timeout and retry mechanisms

### Requirement 6: Security Enhancement

**User Story:** As a security-conscious operator, I want the system to be secure against common vulnerabilities and follow security best practices, so that user data and system integrity are protected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN handling user input THEN the system SHALL validate and sanitize all inputs to prevent injection attacks
2. WHEN managing secrets THEN the system SHALL store and handle API keys and sensitive data securely
3. WHEN processing files THEN the system SHALL validate file types and prevent malicious file uploads
4. WHEN making external requests THEN the system SHALL implement proper SSL/TLS verification and security headers
5. WHEN logging data THEN the system SHALL avoid logging sensitive information
6. WHEN handling authentication THEN the system SHALL implement proper access controls and rate limiting

### Requirement 7: Testing Infrastructure

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive testing infrastructure, so that I can ensure code quality and prevent regressions during development.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN writing unit tests THEN the system SHALL provide comprehensive test coverage for all critical functions
2. WHEN implementing integration tests THEN the system SHALL test component interactions and external service integrations
3. WHEN setting up test fixtures THEN the system SHALL provide reusable test data and mock objects
4. WHEN running tests THEN the system SHALL support automated test execution and reporting
5. WHEN testing async code THEN the system SHALL properly test asynchronous operations and error conditions
6. WHEN validating configuration THEN the system SHALL test configuration loading and validation logic

### Requirement 8: Documentation and Code Comments

**User Story:** As a new developer joining the project, I want comprehensive documentation and clear code comments, so that I can quickly understand and contribute to the codebase.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN documenting APIs THEN the system SHALL provide clear API documentation with examples
2. WHEN writing code comments THEN the system SHALL explain complex logic and business rules
3. WHEN creating architectural documentation THEN the system SHALL document system design and component relationships
4. WHEN providing setup instructions THEN the system SHALL include comprehensive installation and configuration guides
5. WHEN documenting configuration THEN the system SHALL explain all configuration options and their effects
6. WHEN maintaining documentation THEN the system SHALL keep documentation synchronized with code changes
