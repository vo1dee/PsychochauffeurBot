# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The current test suite has a coverage of 43.06%, which is below the required threshold of 50%. This feature aims to systematically improve test coverage by targeting modules with low or zero coverage, focusing on critical functionality and ensuring robust testing practices.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive test coverage for critical modules, so that I can ensure code reliability and meet CI/CD requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the test suite is executed THEN the total coverage SHALL be at least 50%
2. WHEN targeting modules with 0% coverage THEN priority SHALL be given to modules with high statement counts
3. WHEN writing tests THEN they SHALL cover both happy path and error scenarios
4. WHEN implementing tests THEN they SHALL follow existing test patterns and conventions

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want tests for modules with zero coverage, so that critical functionality is validated and potential bugs are caught early.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN identifying zero-coverage modules THEN the system SHALL prioritize modules based on criticality and statement count
2. WHEN testing zero-coverage modules THEN tests SHALL cover core functionality, error handling, and edge cases
3. WHEN implementing tests THEN they SHALL use appropriate mocking for external dependencies
4. WHEN testing async functionality THEN tests SHALL properly handle async/await patterns

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to improve coverage for partially tested modules, so that existing functionality is more thoroughly validated.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing partially covered modules THEN the system SHALL identify untested code paths
2. WHEN adding tests to existing modules THEN new tests SHALL complement existing test coverage
3. WHEN testing complex modules THEN tests SHALL cover different execution branches and conditions
4. WHEN improving coverage THEN tests SHALL maintain or improve code quality standards

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want maintainable and efficient tests, so that the test suite remains valuable over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN writing tests THEN they SHALL follow DRY principles and use shared fixtures where appropriate
2. WHEN creating test utilities THEN they SHALL be reusable across multiple test modules
3. WHEN testing similar functionality THEN tests SHALL use parameterized testing where beneficial
4. WHEN implementing tests THEN they SHALL have clear, descriptive names and documentation
