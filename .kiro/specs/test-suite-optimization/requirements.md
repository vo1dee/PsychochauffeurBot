# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on optimizing the existing test suite for the PsychoChauffeur Telegram bot application. The current test coverage is only 18%, with many critical modules having 0% coverage. The goal is to analyze the existing test suite, identify redundant or unnecessary tests, and recommend new tests to achieve comprehensive coverage while ensuring tests accurately reflect program functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a QA engineer, I want to validate that existing tests accurately represent program functionality, so that I can ensure the test suite provides reliable feedback about code correctness.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing existing test files THEN the system SHALL identify tests that don't align with current code behavior
2. WHEN evaluating test coverage THEN the system SHALL determine if critical functionalities are adequately covered
3. WHEN reviewing test assertions THEN the system SHALL verify they test meaningful program behavior
4. IF a test fails consistently without indicating a real bug THEN the system SHALL flag it as potentially misconfigured

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to remove unnecessary and redundant tests, so that the test suite is efficient and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN scanning test files THEN the system SHALL detect redundant tests covering identical scenarios
2. WHEN analyzing test relevance THEN the system SHALL identify tests for removed or deprecated features
3. WHEN evaluating test value THEN the system SHALL flag trivial tests that add no meaningful validation
4. WHEN reviewing failing tests THEN the system SHALL identify tests that fail due to misconfiguration rather than bugs
5. IF multiple tests cover the same functionality THEN the system SHALL recommend consolidation or removal

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive test coverage recommendations, so that I can increase confidence in code correctness and catch bugs early.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing code coverage THEN the system SHALL identify modules with low or zero test coverage
2. WHEN examining untested code paths THEN the system SHALL recommend specific test cases for critical functionality
3. WHEN evaluating error handling THEN the system SHALL suggest tests for exception paths and edge cases
4. WHEN reviewing integration points THEN the system SHALL recommend integration tests for component interactions
5. IF a module has business-critical functionality THEN the system SHALL prioritize test recommendations based on criticality

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want specific test implementation guidance, so that I can efficiently create high-quality tests.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN recommending new tests THEN the system SHALL specify the test type (unit, integration, end-to-end)
2. WHEN suggesting test cases THEN the system SHALL describe what functionality should be tested and why
3. WHEN prioritizing recommendations THEN the system SHALL rank them based on code criticality and risk
4. WHEN providing test examples THEN the system SHALL include specific implementation patterns and best practices
5. IF existing test patterns are available THEN the system SHALL recommend following established conventions

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a project maintainer, I want a comprehensive analysis report, so that I can make informed decisions about test suite improvements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating the analysis report THEN the system SHALL provide detailed findings for each category
2. WHEN documenting recommendations THEN the system SHALL include rationale and expected impact
3. WHEN presenting results THEN the system SHALL organize findings by priority and module
4. WHEN suggesting improvements THEN the system SHALL estimate effort required for implementation
5. IF critical gaps are found THEN the system SHALL highlight them prominently in the report
