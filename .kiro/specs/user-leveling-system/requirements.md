# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for implementing a comprehensive leveling and achievement system for the Telegram group bot. The system will track user activity, assign experience points (XP), manage user levels, and unlock achievements based on specific behaviors and milestones. This gamification feature will enhance user engagement and create a more interactive group chat experience.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: XP Assignment System

**User Story:** As a group chat member, I want to earn experience points for my activities so that I can progress and be recognized for my participation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user sends any message THEN the system SHALL award 1 XP to that user
2. WHEN a user shares a link (containing "http://" or "https://") THEN the system SHALL award 3 XP to that user
3. WHEN a user receives thanks (message mentions them with "@user" or reply to, and contains thank keywords(thanks, thank you, 10x, –¥—è–∫—É—é, –¥—è–∫–∏, –¥—è–∫—ñ, —Å–ø–∞—Å–∏–±—ñ, —Å–ø—Å, –¥—è–∫ —ñ —Ç–¥)) THEN the system SHALL award 5 XP to that user
4. WHEN XP is awarded THEN the system SHALL update the user's total XP in the database
5. WHEN XP is awarded THEN the system SHALL update relevant activity counters (messages_count, links_shared, thanks_received)

### Requirement 2: Level Progression System

**User Story:** As a group chat member, I want to level up automatically based on my accumulated XP so that I can see my progression over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user's total XP reaches a level threshold THEN the system SHALL automatically increase their level
2. WHEN a user levels up THEN the system SHALL send a congratulatory message to the group chat mentionin their lvl achieved and promptin to /profile for more stats
