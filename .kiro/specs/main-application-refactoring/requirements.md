# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The PsychochauffeurBot's main.py file has grown into a monolithic structure with 793 lines of code handling multiple responsibilities including bot initialization, message handling, command registration, speech recognition, and application lifecycle management. This creates significant maintainability, testability, and reliability issues. The current test coverage for main.py is only 18%, indicating poor testability due to the tightly coupled architecture.

This feature aims to refactor the monolithic main.py into a modular, well-structured application architecture that separates concerns, improves testability, and enhances maintainability while preserving all existing functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the main application entry point to be focused solely on application bootstrapping, so that the codebase is easier to understand and maintain.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN main.py SHALL contain only application bootstrapping logic (under 100 lines)
2. WHEN the application starts THEN main.py SHALL delegate all business logic to specialized modules
3. WHEN the application starts THEN the entry point SHALL follow single responsibility principle
4. WHEN reviewing the code THEN the main.py file SHALL be easily understandable by new developers

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want message handling logic separated from the main entry point, so that I can test and modify message processing independently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a message is received THEN the message handling SHALL be processed by a dedicated MessageHandler class
2. WHEN implementing new message types THEN the system SHALL support adding handlers without modifying main.py
3. WHEN testing message handling THEN each handler SHALL be testable in isolation
4. WHEN a message processing error occurs THEN the error SHALL be handled by the dedicated handler without affecting other components

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want command registration and management separated into its own module, so that adding new commands doesn't require modifying the main application file.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN command registration SHALL be handled by a dedicated CommandRegistry class
2. WHEN adding new commands THEN developers SHALL register commands through the registry interface
3. WHEN the application initializes THEN all commands SHALL be automatically discovered and registered
4. WHEN testing commands THEN each command SHALL be testable independently of the main application

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the application lifecycle managed by a dedicated orchestrator, so that startup and shutdown procedures are reliable and testable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN initialization SHALL be managed by an ApplicationOrchestrator class
2. WHEN the application shuts down THEN cleanup SHALL be performed in the correct order by the orchestrator
3. WHEN an initialization error occurs THEN the orchestrator SHALL handle graceful failure and cleanup
4. WHEN testing the application lifecycle THEN startup and shutdown procedures SHALL be testable independently

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want speech recognition functionality separated into its own service, so that it can be maintained and tested independently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN voice messages are received THEN processing SHALL be handled by a dedicated SpeechRecognitionService
2. WHEN speech recognition settings change THEN the service SHALL handle configuration updates independently
3. WHEN testing speech recognition THEN the service SHALL be mockable and testable in isolation
4. WHEN speech recognition fails THEN errors SHALL be contained within the service

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want dependency injection used throughout the application, so that components are loosely coupled and easily testable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN components are created THEN dependencies SHALL be injected rather than directly instantiated
2. WHEN testing components THEN dependencies SHALL be easily mockable through injection
3. WHEN the application starts THEN a dependency container SHALL manage component lifecycles
4. WHEN adding new components THEN they SHALL follow the dependency injection pattern

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive test coverage for the refactored components, so that the system is reliable and regressions are prevented.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the refactoring is complete THEN test coverage SHALL be at least 85% for all new components
2. WHEN testing the application THEN unit tests SHALL exist for each component in isolation
3. WHEN testing integration THEN integration tests SHALL verify component interactions
4. WHEN running tests THEN they SHALL execute quickly and reliably without external dependencies

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the existing bot functionality preserved exactly, so that users experience no disruption during the refactoring.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the refactoring is complete THEN all existing commands SHALL work identically
2. WHEN messages are processed THEN behavior SHALL be identical to the current implementation
3. WHEN the bot starts THEN all existing features SHALL be available
4. WHEN errors occur THEN error handling SHALL maintain the same behavior as before

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear interfaces between components, so that the system is maintainable and extensible.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN components interact THEN they SHALL use well-defined interfaces
2. WHEN implementing new features THEN interfaces SHALL guide implementation
3. WHEN reviewing code THEN component boundaries SHALL be clear and logical
4. WHEN modifying components THEN changes SHALL be isolated by interface boundaries

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a developer, I want configuration and logging properly integrated into the new architecture, so that the system remains observable and configurable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN components are created THEN they SHALL receive configuration through dependency injection
2. WHEN logging occurs THEN it SHALL use the existing logging infrastructure
3. WHEN configuration changes THEN components SHALL be notified appropriately
4. WHEN debugging issues THEN logs SHALL provide clear component-level information
